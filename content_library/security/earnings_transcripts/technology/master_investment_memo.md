With that, operator, let's open the line for questions.

## Question and Answer Session

**Operator**: Thank you. We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Michael Chen with Northgate Analytics.

**Michael Chen, Northgate Analytics**: Good afternoon. My question is on net revenue retention. You reported {{NRR_PCT}}% NRR this quarter. Can you break down the drivers between expansion, upselling, and cross-selling? And how sustainable is this level?

**{{CEO_NAME}}**: Thanks, Michael. Great question. The {{NRR_PCT}}% NRR is driven by several factors:

First, **workload expansion** within existing customers as they migrate more workloads to our platform. This represents about 40% of the expansion.

Second, **product upselling** as customers adopt premium tiers and additional modules. This is about 35% of expansion.

Third, **cross-selling** of new products like our AI capabilities to existing customers. This represents the remaining 25% and is our fastest-growing expansion vector.

On sustainability, we believe this NRR level is sustainable and potentially improvable. Our product roadmap includes several new capabilities that should drive continued expansion, and our customer success investments are paying off in higher engagement and adoption.

**{{CFO_NAME}}**: I'll add that the enterprise segment is particularly strong, with NRR exceeding 135%. As enterprise becomes a larger share of our business, overall NRR should benefit from that mix shift.

**Operator**: Our next question comes from Jennifer Martinez with Fairmont Capital Insights.

**Jennifer Martinez, Fairmont Capital Insights**: Hi, thank you. Can you provide more detail on customer acquisition trends? What are you seeing in terms of CAC, sales cycles, and competitive win rates?

**{{CFO_NAME}}**: Jennifer, I'll take that one. On CAC, we're seeing continued improvement driven by:
- Better lead qualification and targeting
- AI-assisted selling tools improving sales productivity
- Strong brand recognition reducing marketing spend requirements

Sales cycles in enterprise have shortened slightly, from an average of 6-9 months to 5-8 months. Customers are making decisions faster as cloud adoption becomes less of a strategic question and more of an implementation priority.

On competitive win rates, we're winning approximately 65-70% of competitive situations where we're invited to bid. This is up from about 60% two years ago, reflecting our technology differentiation and customer references.

**{{CEO_NAME}}**: I'd add that our land-and-expand motion is particularly effective. We often start with a smaller initial deployment and then expand significantly over 12-24 months. This reduces initial friction while allowing us to demonstrate value before larger commitments.

**Operator**: Our next question comes from David Park with Sterling Wharf Intelligence.

**David Park, Sterling Wharf Intelligence**: Good afternoon. Question on the AI investments. Can you quantify the ROI you're seeing on AI initiatives? And how should we think about the margin impact of these investments?

**{{CEO_NAME}}**: David, the ROI on our AI investments is very attractive. Let me share some metrics:

**Customer-Facing AI:**
- Products with AI features have 40% higher adoption rates
- Customer satisfaction scores are 15 points higher for AI-enabled features
- Expansion rates are 25% higher for customers using AI capabilities

**Internal AI (Operations):**
- Customer support costs reduced 20% through AI-assisted resolution
- Sales productivity improved 15% through AI-assisted selling
- Development velocity increased 25% through AI coding assistants

**{{CFO_NAME}}**: On margin impact, AI investments are currently a modest headwind to margins — perhaps 100-150 basis points. However, we view this as an investment phase. As AI features drive higher customer adoption, retention, and expansion, the revenue benefits should significantly outweigh the cost investments over the next 2-3 years.

The infrastructure investments in particular have attractive unit economics. Our AI compute costs are declining 30-40% annually while capabilities improve, which will drive margin expansion over time.

**Operator**: Our next question comes from Rebecca Foster with Granite Peak Advisory.

**Rebecca Foster, Granite Peak Advisory**: Hi there. I wanted to ask about the competitive landscape. Are you seeing any changes in competitive intensity or pricing pressure?

**{{CEO_NAME}}**: Rebecca, competition remains intense, but I'd characterise the environment as stable rather than deteriorating.

On pricing, we have seen some discounting from competitors, particularly in the mid-market segment. However, our approach has been to lead with value rather than match on price. When customers evaluate total cost of ownership — including productivity gains, reduced operational overhead, and superior capabilities — we consistently win on value proposition.

Our win rates remain strong, and we're not seeing material changes in our ability to maintain pricing. The customers who choose us are willing to pay a premium for quality and capability.

**{{CFO_NAME}}**: I'd add that our gross margins are stable to improving, which suggests we're not experiencing meaningful pricing pressure. If anything, mix shift toward higher-value products is supporting margin expansion.

**Operator**: Our final question comes from Kevin Walsh with Regent Square Analytics.

**Kevin Walsh, Regent Square Analytics**: Good afternoon. My question is on capital allocation. With strong cash generation and the new buyback authorisation, how are you thinking about the balance between buybacks, M&A, and organic investment?

**{{CFO_NAME}}**: Kevin, our capital allocation framework remains consistent:

**Priority 1 - Organic Investment:** This is always our first priority. We're investing aggressively in R&D, sales capacity, and infrastructure where we see compelling returns. Expect continued investment in AI, international expansion, and new product development.

**Priority 2 - Strategic M&A:** We remain active in evaluating M&A opportunities, focused on technology and talent acquisition that accelerates our roadmap. We're disciplined on valuation and strategic fit.

**Priority 3 - Shareholder Returns:** With the new $10B buyback authorisation, we'll be active in repurchasing shares. We're also evaluating potential dividend initiation, though no decision has been made.

**{{CEO_NAME}}**: I'd emphasise that we're in a fortunate position where we can invest for growth while also returning capital to shareholders. We don't view these as trade-offs — our cash generation supports both priorities.

## {{CEO_NAME}} — Closing Remarks

Before we close, I want to reiterate a few key points:

First, {{COMPANY_NAME}} delivered another quarter of strong financial performance and strategic progress. Revenue growth of {{YOY_GROWTH_PCT}}%, NRR of {{NRR_PCT}}%, and operating margin of {{OPERATING_MARGIN_PCT}}% demonstrate the strength of our business model.

Second, our key business metrics — customer count, ACV, retention, and expansion — all moved in the right direction, setting us up well for continued growth.

Third, our strategic investments in AI, cloud platform, and international expansion position us to capture significant long-term opportunities.

Thank you all for your time today and your continued interest in {{COMPANY_NAME}}. We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter.

**Operator**: This concludes today's {{COMPANY_NAME}} {{FISCAL_QUARTER}} {{FISCAL_YEAR}} earnings conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.
